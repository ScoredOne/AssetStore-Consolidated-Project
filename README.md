https://assetstore.unity.com/publishers/35238
 
A single git containing the 4 projects uploaded to the Unity Asset Store:
- Procedurally Generated Destructible Character
- Destruction Tree Manager
- Scored's Behaviour Tree Script
- Scored's UI Fade Script System

This git is to act as a resting place for these projects, for developers and employers to quickly go over the code without needing to import the packages.
